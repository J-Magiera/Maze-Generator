# Maze-Generator
Repository for my maze generator implementation in C for embedded project.

Project goals:

  Algorithm part:
  - Implement maze generatior algorithm in C (with guaranteed path from start to end)
  - Define collision for square elements
  - Design movement mechanics for "square" player model inside maze

  Embedded part:
  - Create library for 240x320 LCD display (for further use)
  - Create library for GPIO button controls
  - Create library for accelerometer controls (optional)
  - Design include files so that project builds and works for both FRDM-k20d50m and FRDM-kl25z development boards (optional)
